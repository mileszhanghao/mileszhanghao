## introduction 
We all know the pandemic of the covid-19 caused so many people to die. It is very important to know and stop the virus from transporting. So I want to know about how the virus transporting in the world. 
The first step in finding the background and history of the covid-19. We can check the virus is from the end of 2019, and it is growing in 2020. 
The next step is searching the news in 2020. There are so many data visualizations like charts in the news. 
Finally, I find out the most meaningful data visualizations for me. This is a world map to show us different religions pandemic.

## description
In the [data visualization](https://blog.gramener.com/visualizing-covid-19-spread-on-choropleth-map/), we can see some virus designs which are the symbol of the coronavirus. There is a world map to show the order of severity of different regions in the world. 
For example, most countries are red, which means these countries already appeared the cases of covid-19. The deeper red means more population of people got the covid-19. 
So, we can see the United States and China are the reddest countries on the map. It means these two countries have the most people who are sick during the pandemic in 2020.

## Data Feminism: What I Learned?

***The definition of data deminism is that***, 
> a way of thinking about data, both therir uses and their limits, that is informed by direct experience, by a commitment to action, and by intersectional feminist thougt.

(I don't have the page number, but it is in the last paragraph of the sub-title;"What Is Data Feminism" in the introdution part of the book)
So, let me say what I learned in Data Feminism. I would say that technology changes the human community. 
The situation in the last century in the United States, people are trying their best to make a balance equal between males and females. 
But it is not an easy thing to see all the unequal events when they are happening. 
The solution is that the females who received the highest education have an ideal. They use the computer to stop this kind of thing appeared. 
They give the data to the computer and let the computer calculate and fix the unequal. 
This event tells me, we can use what we learn to help the community what we are living. ðŸ˜€
